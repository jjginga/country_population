# country_population
One of my projects for the Object Oriented Programming subject at Universidade Aberta in c++. 
It reads country data from a csv file and presents if for the user in the terminal.

You can list the countries, sort them, show the detail of an individual one and calculate the total population of the world.

We used 3 classes, Country (the abstraction of the country), World (the countainer of all countries) and Menu (that shows all the options)
